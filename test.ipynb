OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\\n\\n| Category | Findings |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| **Strengths** | 1. **Hands‑on project portfolio** – Image captioning web app & flight‑price prediction platform show end‑to‑end skills (data prep → model → deployment). <br>2. **Broad technical stack** – Includes deep‑learning libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras), data‑science tools (pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn), and web dev tech (Flask, HTML/CSS). <br>3. **Clear passion statement** – “Passionate about leveraging AI to solve real‑world problems” signals motivation and fit for data‑driven teams. |\\n| **Weaknesses** | 1. **Redundant & inconsistent skill listings** – “Python” appears twice; “commputer vision” typo; “pytorch” repeated. <br>2. **Lack of quantifiable impact** – Project descriptions are generic (“performed full EDA”) without metrics. <br>3. **Missing soft skills & certifications** – No mention of teamwork, communication, or relevant certificates (e.g., AWS AI/ML, Coursera Deep Learning). <br>4. **Education section missing GPA, relevant coursework, or honors** – Reduces credibility for a fresh graduate. |\\n| **Industry fit** | 1. **AI / Machine‑Learning Engineer** – Building & deploying ML models. <br>2. **Data Scientist / Analyst** – End‑to‑end data projects, feature engineering, EDA. <br>3. **Computer‑Vision Engineer** – Image captioning & related CV tasks. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2. CONTENT IMPROVEMENTS**\\n\\n| Area | Current Issue | Suggested Rewrite / Action |\\n|------|---------------|---------------------------|\\n| **Achievements** | Vague: “Developed an Image Captioning Web Application…” | 1. **Quantify model accuracy**: “Built an image‑captioning model that achieved BLEU‑4 score of 0.32, outperforming baseline by 15%.” <br>2. **Impact on users**: “Launched a flight‑price prediction platform that reduced average ticket cost for 200+ users by 12%.” <br>3. **Deployment & scaling**: “Deployed the captioning model on AWS Lambda, handling 5,000 concurrent requests with <1\\u202fs latency.” |\\n| **Skills presentation** | Mixed list with duplicates, no hierarchy. | • Split into **“Technical Proficiencies”** → **Programming Languages, Libraries, Frameworks, Tools, Databases**. <br>• Use bullet points or two‑column table for readability. <br>• Remove duplicates, correct typos (“Computer Vision”). |\\n| **Missing skills** | Based on projects, you likely used: <br>• **Version control & CI/CD** (Git, GitHub Actions). <br>• **Docker / containerization** for deployment. <br>• **Cloud services** (AWS SageMaker, GCP AI Platform). <br>• **Model monitoring & logging** (MLflow, Prometheus). | Add these to the skills section or mention them in project descriptions. |\\n| **Education details** | Only institution, degree, dates. | • Add **GPA** (if ≥3.5). <br>• List **relevant coursework** (Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Mining). <br>• Mention any **project titles** or **capstone** that align with your work. |\\n| **Professional summary** | Missing. | Add a 2‑sentence summary at the top: “Data‑science graduate with 2+ years of experience building end‑to‑end AI solutions, including a 15%‑improved flight‑price predictor and a real‑time image‑captioning web app. Adept at Python, PyTorch, and Flask, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis and model deployment.” |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.

Keep each project description to 3‑4 bullets. |\\n| **Readability** | • Use **bold** for section headings and project titles. <br>• Keep font size 10‑11 pt for body, 12‑14 pt for headings. <br>• Use **bullet points** and **consistent tense** (past tense for completed work). <br>• Avoid large blocks of text; use concise, action‑oriented sentences. <br>• Include **white space** (margin 0.5‑0.75”). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4. ATS OPTIMIZATION**\\n\\n| Focus | Action |\\n|-------|--------|\\n| **Keywords** | Add the following (tailor to job posting): <br>1. **Model Deployment** <br>2. **MLOps** <br>3. **Docker** <br>4. **AWS SageMaker** <br>5. **Data Pipeline** <br>6. **Feature Engineering** <br>7. **Model Evaluation** |\\n| **Formatting pitfalls** | • Do not use tables or text boxes; ATS may skip them. <br>• Avoid images, icons, or logos. <br>• Keep headings simple (“Skills”, “Experience”) – ATS maps them automatically. <br>• Use standard bullet characters (• or –). |\\n| **File format** | Submit as a **PDF** (most ATS read PDFs reliably) or **Word (.docx)** if the system explicitly requires it.

\"OrbitronAI.com\", \"location\": \"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India\", \"description\": \"OrbitronAI is on a mission to turn large language model magic into production-grade agentic systems and workflows that solve real problems for the world’s largest enterprises.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve recently raised $10 million in seed funding 💰 and are scaling fast across Dubai, Bengaluru, and Saudi Arabia.\\\\n\\\\n👥 The Team Behind OrbitronAI\\\\n\\\\nFounded by an exceptional leadership team of:\\\\n• Former EY Partners\\\\n• Ex-CTOs and Heads of Engineering from successful Series B+ startups\\\\n\\\\nThe founding team brings together seasoned business, product and engineering leaders who have built and scaled organizations and led enterprise projects valued at over $1 billion.\\\\n\\\\n🌟 Why Join OrbitronAI?\\\\n• Massive Impact, Real Ownership → Ship end-to-end features, own outcomes, and see your work power mission-critical systems.\\\\n• Battle-Tested Leadership → Learn and grow with seasoned leaders who bring deep industry expertise and zero ego.\\\\n• Cutting Edge Stack → Work with GenAI frontier models, Java, Python, Go, TypeScript, GCP & edge compute, Vector DBs, DAG engines.\\\\n\\\\n🧬 Our Cultural DNA\\\\n• Hustle → Move with urgency, bias for action, celebrate shipping.\\\\n• Ownership & Commitment → Act like a founder — your decisions shape the company.\\\\n• Founder’s Mindset → Challenge ideas, not people. Seek truth, not consensus.\\\\n• Continuous Learning → No legacy thinking; we invest in upskilling and sponsor courses & conferences.\\\\n• Pride in Craft → Pixel-perfect UIs, rock-solid infra, clean code. If it has your name on it, make it remarkable.\\\\n• No-Ego Zone → Brilliant ≠ arrogant. We win together by being kind, direct, and respectful.\\\\n\\\\nWhy This Role\\\\n\\\\nWe’re not building yet another AI tool — we’re building agentic systems that think, decide, and act autonomously inside real enterprises. This isn’t just about chatbots or wrappers around LLM APIs. It’s about unlocking the next paradigm of software where AI agents become teammates — navigating data, taking action, coordinating with systems, and adapting over time.\\\\n\\\\nAs an early AI engineer, you won’t just fine-tune prompts — you’ll architect intelligent systems that operate across CRMs, databases, compliance tools, customer workflows, and more. This is your chance to shape how agents are built and deployed in the real world, not just demoed in labs. We’re looking for ambitious minds who want to build something foundational — not just follow trends.\\\\n\\\\nBonus: You’ll work in an environment where using AI tools to boost your own efficiency is expected, not optional.\\\\n\\\\nWhat You’ll Do\\\\n\\\\nAt our startup, we’re not just building AI features — we’re rethinking how software behaves through agents that perceive, plan, and act in enterprise environments. As one of our early AI engineers, you’ll:\\\\n• Design and deploy cutting-edge AI agents using our orchestration layer built on n8n, Temporal, and next-gen agentic stacks.\\\\n• Build intelligent, context-aware workflows that plug directly into enterprise systems — transforming how business make decisions, serve customers, and manage operations.\\\\n• Prototype fast. Iterate faster. You’ll test, fail, learn, and ship production-grade AI agent flows that power real business outcomes.\\\\n• Collaborate with product and design to identify high-impact user journeys where AI can be a 10x unlock — and then build them.\\\\n• Push the limits of RAG, embeddings, and vector search to bring real-time, grounded intelligence into every agent decision.\\\\n• Engineer smart integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, and other LLMs — blending in enterprise APIs, CRMs, internal tools, and more.\\\\n• Lead development of multi-agent orchestration flows: planner-executor models, memory layers, persona-based behaviors, and tool-using agents.\\\\n• Own the AI pipeline end-to-end: prompt engineering, dynamic context handling, agent simulation and evaluation, all the way to deployment and monitoring.\\\\n• Help set the bar for reliability, latency, and safety of AI outputs — your work will shape how users trust AI inside their organizations.\\\\n• Work alongside curious, driven people who care deeply about shipping transformative products, not just academic demos.\\\\n\\\\nWhat You Bring\\\\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience.\\\\n• 5+ years of hands-on experience in applied machine learning, NLP, or AI system development, particularly with LLMs and agentic frameworks.\\\\n• Deep familairity with large language models such as GPT-4, Claude, or similar; including prompt tuning, fine-tuning, or API-based deployment.\\\\n• Hands-on experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using vector stores and embeddings.\\\\n• Knowledge of multi-agent systems, task orchestration, and related architectures.\\\\n• Proficiency in Python and modern ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).\\\\n• Experience integrating with agent orchestration frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, Temporal, n8n, or custom stacks.\\\\n• Solid understanding of enterprise software principles, including version control, CI/CD pipelines, API design, and performance monitoring.\\\\n• Excellent communication and collaboration skills;

\"OrbitronAI.com\", \"location\": \"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India\", \"description\": \"OrbitronAI is on a mission to turn large language model magic into production-grade agentic systems and workflows that solve real problems for the world’s largest enterprises.\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve recently raised $10 million in seed funding 💰 and are scaling fast across Dubai, Bengaluru, and Saudi Arabia.\\\\n\\\\n👥 The Team Behind OrbitronAI\\\\n\\\\nFounded by an exceptional leadership team of:\\\\n• Former EY Partners\\\\n• Ex-CTOs and Heads of Engineering from successful Series B+ startups\\\\n\\\\nThe founding team brings together seasoned business, product and engineering leaders who have built and scaled organizations and led enterprise projects valued at over $1 billion.\\\\n\\\\n🌟 Why Join OrbitronAI?\\\\n• Massive Impact, Real Ownership → Ship end-to-end features, own outcomes, and see your work power mission-critical systems.\\\\n• Battle-Tested Leadership → Learn and grow with seasoned leaders who bring deep industry expertise and zero ego.\\\\n• Cutting Edge Stack → Work with GenAI frontier models, Java, Python, Go, TypeScript, GCP & edge compute, Vector DBs, DAG engines.\\\\n\\\\n🧬 Our Cultural DNA\\\\n• Hustle → Move with urgency, bias for action, celebrate shipping.\\\\n• Ownership & Commitment → Act like a founder — your decisions shape the company.\\\\n• Founder’s Mindset → Challenge ideas, not people. Seek truth, not consensus.\\\\n• Continuous Learning → No legacy thinking; we invest in upskilling and sponsor courses & conferences.\\\\n• Pride in Craft → Pixel-perfect UIs, rock-solid infra, clean code. If it has your name on it, make it remarkable.\\\\n• No-Ego Zone → Brilliant ≠ arrogant. We win together by being kind, direct, and respectful.\\\\n\\\\nWhy This Role\\\\n\\\\nWe’re not building yet another AI tool — we’re building agentic systems that think, decide, and act autonomously inside real enterprises. This isn’t just about chatbots or wrappers around LLM APIs. It’s about unlocking the next paradigm of software where AI agents become teammates — navigating data, taking action, coordinating with systems, and adapting over time.\\\\n\\\\nAs an early AI engineer, you won’t just fine-tune prompts — you’ll architect intelligent systems that operate across CRMs, databases, compliance tools, customer workflows, and more. This is your chance to shape how agents are built and deployed in the real world, not just demoed in labs. We’re looking for ambitious minds who want to build something foundational — not just follow trends.\\\\n\\\\nBonus: You’ll work in an environment where using AI tools to boost your own efficiency is expected, not optional.\\\\n\\\\nWhat You’ll Do\\\\n\\\\nAt our startup, we’re not just building AI features — we’re rethinking how software behaves through agents that perceive, plan, and act in enterprise environments. As one of our early AI engineers, you’ll:\\\\n• Design and deploy cutting-edge AI agents using our orchestration layer built on n8n, Temporal, and next-gen agentic stacks.\\\\n• Build intelligent, context-aware workflows that plug directly into enterprise systems — transforming how business make decisions, serve customers, and manage operations.\\\\n• Prototype fast. Iterate faster. You’ll test, fail, learn, and ship production-grade AI agent flows that power real business outcomes.\\\\n• Collaborate with product and design to identify high-impact user journeys where AI can be a 10x unlock — and then build them.\\\\n• Push the limits of RAG, embeddings, and vector search to bring real-time, grounded intelligence into every agent decision.\\\\n• Engineer smart integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, and other LLMs — blending in enterprise APIs, CRMs, internal tools, and more.\\\\n• Lead development of multi-agent orchestration flows: planner-executor models, memory layers, persona-based behaviors, and tool-using agents.\\\\n• Own the AI pipeline end-to-end: prompt engineering, dynamic context handling, agent simulation and evaluation, all the way to deployment and monitoring.\\\\n• Help set the bar for reliability, latency, and safety of AI outputs — your work will shape how users trust AI inside their organizations.\\\\n• Work alongside curious, driven people who care deeply about shipping transformative products, not just academic demos.\\\\n\\\\nWhat You Bring\\\\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience.\\\\n• 5+ years of hands-on experience in applied machine learning, NLP, or AI system development, particularly with LLMs and agentic frameworks.\\\\n• Deep familairity with large language models such as GPT-4, Claude, or similar; including prompt tuning, fine-tuning, or API-based deployment.\\\\n• Hands-on experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using vector stores and embeddings.\\\\n• Knowledge of multi-agent systems, task orchestration, and related architectures.\\\\n• Proficiency in Python and modern ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).\\\\n• Experience integrating with agent orchestration frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, Temporal, n8n, or custom stacks.\\\\n• Solid understanding of enterprise software principles, including version control, CI/CD pipelines, API design, and performance monitoring.\\\\n• Excellent communication and collaboration skills;

Iterate faster. You’ll test, fail, learn, and ship production-grade AI agent flows that power real business outcomes.\\\\n• Collaborate with product and design to identify high-impact user journeys where AI can be a 10x unlock — and then build them.\\\\n• Push the limits of RAG, embeddings, and vector search to bring real-time, grounded intelligence into every agent decision.\\\\n• Engineer smart integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, and other LLMs — blending in enterprise APIs, CRMs, internal tools, and more.\\\\n• Lead development of multi-agent orchestration flows: planner-executor models, memory layers, persona-based behaviors, and tool-using agents.\\\\n• Own the AI pipeline end-to-end: prompt engineering, dynamic context handling, agent simulation and evaluation, all the way to deployment and monitoring.\\\\n• Help set the bar for reliability, latency, and safety of AI outputs — your work will shape how users trust AI inside their organizations.\\\\n• Work alongside curious, driven people who care deeply about shipping transformative products, not just academic demos.\\\\n\\\\nWhat You Bring\\\\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience.\\\\n• 5+ years of hands-on experience in applied machine learning, NLP, or AI system development, particularly with LLMs and agentic frameworks.\\\\n• Deep familairity with large language models such as GPT-4, Claude, or similar;
